  <div class="stackedit__html"><p>There are five pronouns in toki pona (at least in my analysis). Those pronouns, and what they represent, are:</p>
<pre><code>mi: the one who speaks
sina: the one who is spoken to
ona: an object
ni: an object
seme: an object
</code></pre>
<p>Before I explain further, it’s important to explain the concept of displacement in linguistics. Most linguists agree that in order for a mode of communication to be considered a human language, it has to check off a few boxes. (the concept of “what is a language” is an ongoing debate, so I’m only going to use terms and definitions that I personally find helpful to demonstrate this concept. The ways in which non-human animals and plants and living things communicate is a very interesting topic, and is not the subject of this lipu.) Among others, displacement is one of those boxes. <em><strong>Displacement</strong> is the capability to talk about objects that are not present.</em> Without displacement, you can only talk about objects you can point at.</p>
<p>How do languages handle displacement? I’m not qualified to speak on natural languages, but in toki pona, pronouns are very important. They describe objects outside of displacement, that is objects that you can point at.</p>
<p>mi and sina are unfortunately not as important as the other three, because their meaning is unambiguous. They are pronouns because they always describe objects that are not displaced<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>, but they always describe the same objects (mi always refers to either the speaker or a set of objects that includes the speaker, and sina always refers to the object that is being spoken to or a set of objects that includes the object that is being spoken to). For this reason, it makes more sense to analyze them with the rest of the content words, because the only difference is that their semantic spaces only includes objects that are always present in an utterance.</p>
<p>The other three, on the other hand, are more versatile. ona refers to an object previously mentioned. In contrast, ni refers to an idea or concept previously mentioned (or one that’s about to be mentioned, for example in an “e ni:” construction). seme refers to an object (or an idea/concept) that has not been mentioned, and instead acts as a request for that object to be mentioned. I will compare ona, ni, and seme below, using the same three examples for each.</p>
<p>Usage of ona:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>toki pona</th>
<th>What does it do?</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>soweli li mu tawa mi. ona li pona.</td>
<td>here, ona refers to the soweli. The soweli is pona.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>mute li kama. ona li pona e pilin.</td>
<td>ona refers to “mute,” which might be a group of people. The people improve emotions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>mi lon supa. ona li suli.</td>
<td>ona is referring to the supa. The supa is big.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p>Usage of ni:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>toki pona</th>
<th>What does it do?</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>soweli li mu tawa mi. ni li pona.</td>
<td>“ni” refers to the entire sentence. The event of the soweli’s mu is good, not the soweli.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>mute li kama. ni li pona e pilin.</td>
<td>“ni” refers to “mute li kama.” The coming of the masses improves emotions, not the masses themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>mi lon supa. ni li suli.</td>
<td>“ni” refers to “mi lon supa,” not “supa.” The meaning of suli shifts from “big” to “important.” It’s big news that I’m on the supa.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p>Usage of seme<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>toki pona</th>
<th>What does it do?</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>seme li pona?</td>
<td>seme doesn’t call upon past context, so “soweli li mu tawa mi” would be irrelevant here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>seme li pona e pilin?</td>
<td>when used like this, seme is always a “fill in the blank”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>seme li suli?</td>
<td>once again, seme here is a prompt to provide more context</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><p>There’s another key difference between these three words in usage. When they are used to modify other words, it becomes clear that ni and seme have a more important role. ona, much like other content words, when used as a modifier, shows a relationship between itself and the head it modifies. If we modify soweli with these three, for example, ni and seme are doing something unique.</p>
<p>soweli ona - their animal<br>
soweli ni - this animal<br>
soweli seme - which animal?</p>
<p>Instead of showing a relationship between soweli and ni (which would make it mean something like “this thing’s animal” or “this idea’s animal”) it takes the soweli out of displacement. This soweli exists already within the conversation. “soweli” is a displaced object; “soweli ni” isn’t. seme is similar. “soweli seme” isn’t “who’s animal?” It means “which animal.” This pulls the soweli out of displacement, but in a different way: The soweli described is neither within the context nor outside the context. This soweli exists in the future.</p>
<p>When ni and seme modify a head, that head takes upon their pragmatic roles. A head modified by “ni” does everything ni (or ona) does. The only difference is that it’s talking about a specific type of object. A head modified by “seme” does everything that seme does, but limits the semantic space to whatever the head is. This is fundamentally different from how all other modifiers work in the language, and that’s why these words are so important.</p>

<li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>a common usage of sina can be displaced. Many speakers use sina to refer to a hypothetical object, especially in writing. Example: "sina wile tawa ma Pasiju la o toki tawa jan Kapilu" "if you want to go to Brazil, talk to jan Kapilu" (intended information is that if someone wants to go to Brazil, they should talk to jan Kapilu). mi could be used in a similar way. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p>note that some toki pona speakers choose not to use question marks, instead using periods or other alternatives. <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
